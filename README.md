# KLZ_TS metatranscriptome analysis

We recently performed a study to understand the correlation between COVID-19 and host TS microbiota  on metatranscriptome sequencing experiments

This repository contains the compiled R Markdown documents and python scripts to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript, divided into 3 primary sections:

- *KLZ_figure.rmd* contains most of the analysis methods and plotting code
- *KLZ_clustering_and_dynamics.ipynb* includes code for dynamic changes and sample clustering 
- *Fig2Dclassifier.py* is a script for plotting figure2D, which contains multi ROC curves
